    "text": "Ordinal vs. Nominal Variables\n\nJust as there was a way to subdivide numerical variables, there is a way to further subdivide categorical variables as well.\nAs an example, consider the following two categorical variables: color, and letter grades (i.e. A, B+, etc.)\n\nFirstly, I hope you can see that both of these variables are indeed categorical: there are only a fixed set of values that “color” and “letter grade” can take, with nothing in between.\nNow, clearly letter grades can be ordered: that is, an A is better than a B, which is better than a C, and so on and so forth.\nIn contrast, “green” isnt inherently better than “red”, which isn’t inherently better than “grey”, and so on and so forth."

    "section": "Small Caveat",
    "text": "Small Caveat\n\nI should quickly mention one small caveat- computing softwares often use a different procedure for computing quartiles.\nThis procedure is quite long and complicated, and is based off an entire paper written back in the 90’s.\nFor example, if we consider the set \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), we would (based on the definition from the previous slide) call the first quartile \\(2\\), whereas most softwares would return a value of \\(2.25\\).\nDon’t worry about why this is- whenever we talk about quartiles in this class, you can just think of the definition I posed on the previous slide."

    "text": "Whiskers\n\nFinally, we discuss the role of the whiskers on the boxplot.\nThere are several different conventions for how far the whiskers extend. In some conventions, the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values of the data.\nThe convention we will use is the following: the whiskers will never reach farther than \\(\\boldsymbol{1.5 \\times (Q_3 - Q_1)}\\).\n\nWhat this means is that there may be points in our dataset that lie beyond the reach of the whiskers. These points are what we call outliers."

    "text": "Whiskers\n\n\nThe rationale for constructing the whiskers in this way is to try and highlight any points that are unusually distant from the rest of the data.\n\n\n\nFor example, returning to our dataset of scores, we can see that though the median score was around 80.3% there was one person who scored a 97.9%. Because this score is unusually large, we would label it an outlier."
