As our world becomes ever more saturated with data, the need for data literacy becomes increasingly important. By the end of this course, I hope you will be able to think critically about statistical studies and results, understand how data can be used to simultaneously inform and manipulate, and begin applying your newfound techniques to your future endeavors. I am very much looking forward to a great quarter with all of you!\n— Ethan"

    "text": "Course Components\nThe following are the assignments and metrics that will be used to compute your final grade in this course:\n\nLabs\nEvery Monday you will work through a Lab worksheet that will be posted to the website by the previous day. You will then have until 40 minutes after the end of your scheduled section to submit your work through Gradescope. Your TA will explain more about the structure of lab during your first Section meeting of the quarter.\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes will be administered asynchronously on Fridays, through Gradescope. Specifically, the quiz will remain open from 10am until 11:59pm, and you must find 40 consecutive minutes to take the quiz. (Consecutive means you cannot start the quiz, and then come back to it later- once you start, you will have 40 minutes to both complete the quiz as well as upload your work). I encourage you to spend 25 minutes working on the quiz, and 15 minutes uploading. No quiz scores will be dropped. There are no quizzes in Exam Weeks.\n\n\nExams\nThere are two midterms and a final exam for this class. You are required to take all three exams; failure to do so will result in an automatic grade of “F”, so please ensure you are able to take the exams on the dates listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Dates:\n\n\n\n\nMidterm 1 is scheduled to take place Thursday July 6 from 11:00am - 12:20pm (lecture time)\nMidterm 2 is scheduled to take place Thursday July 20 from 11:00am - 12:20pm (lecture time)\nThe final is scheduled to take place FRIDAY, AUGUST 4 from 4 - 7pm\n\n\n\nAll exams are scheduled to take place in our lecture classroom, ILP 1101. Unless stated otherwise, all exams will be cumulative.\n\n\nHomework:\nHomework for this class will be neither collected nor graded. However, the weekly quizzes will be based heavily (though potentially not entirely) off the homework assignments. Homework assignments will be released on Mondays, along with their final answers. Solutions will be posted biweekly, on the Tuesdays before exams. As such, you should not rely on the solutions to help you study; instead, please come to office hours to check your work regularly!\n\n\nSchedule of Due Dates\nA tentative schedule of release and due dates can be found here"

Additionally, make-up exams cannot be accommodated.\nYour final letter grade will be issued according to the following scheme (cutoffs between plusses and minuses will be calculated at the end of the quarter):\n\nA– – A+: 90 – 100%\nB– – B+: 80 – 89.99%\nC– – C+: 70 – 79.99%\nD– – D+ : 60 – 69.99%\nF: 0 – 59.99%\n\nI have elected to adopt an uncurved grading scheme to eliminate any sense of “competition” among students; I highly encourage you all to collaborate with and uplift each other. Having said that, I will certainly consider adjusting the cutoffs (naturally, in everyone’s favor) at the end of the quarter if necessary."

This means, among other things, that the work you submit should be entirely your own and not copied from any external sources. Collaboration on non-quiz and non-exam assignments is perfectly acceptable (and even encouraged), but the work you submit should still be your own; you can’t have someone else write up solutions for you.\nAnyone found guilty of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Senate, and will receive at minimum a failing grade on the assignment in question; further actions may also include failing the course, and marks being made on permanent records. Depending on the severity of the infraction, expulsion is also a possibility.\nBasically, don’t cheat- please! If you’re ever struggling with course material, please come talk to me or the TA’s. We are truly here for you, and want only the best for you."
