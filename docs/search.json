    "text": "Modules, Revisited\nBefore we talk about plotting, we will need to quickly talk about modules again. Recall from Lab01 that modules are Python files containing definitions for functions and classes. Up until now, we’ve been importing all functions and classes from a module using the command\n\nfrom <module name> import *\n\nThere is another way to import modules, which is the following:\n\nimport <module name> as <abbreviation>\n\nFor example,\n\nimport numpy np\n\nnot only imports the numpy module but imports it with the abbreviation (i.e. nickname) np so that we can simply write np in place of numpy.\n\nThe reason this is particularly useful is because module names can sometimes be quite long, so being able to refer to the module with a shortened nickname will save a lot of time!\n\nIn general, if we import a module using\n\nimport <module name> as <abbreviation>\n\nwe reference functions from <module name> using the syntax\n\n<abbreviation>.<function name>()\n\nFor example, after having imported the numpy module with the nickname np, we access the sin() function contained in the numpy module by calling\n\nnp.sin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\n\n\n\n\nImport the numpy module as np, and check that np.sin(0) returns a value of 0.\nImport the datascience module as ds, and check that\n\n\nds.Table().with_columns(\n  \"Col1\", [1, 2, 3],\n  \"Col2\", [2, 3, 4]\n)\n\ncorrectly displays as\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Col1 Col2\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            1    2   \n        \n        \n            2    3   \n        \n        \n            3    4   \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you import a module with an abbreviation <abbreviation>, you must always use the abbreviation when referencing the module; not the original module name.\n\n\nFor example, after importing numpy as np, running numpy.sin() would return an error."

Similarly, to compute the median of a list or array we can use np.median().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\n\n\n\nLet x_list be a list containing the elements 1, 2, and 3, and let x_array be an array containing the elements 1, 2, and 3. Compute the mean and median of x_list and x_array using the appropriate functions from the numpy module.\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Spread\nRecall that we also discussed several measures of spread:\n\nStandard deviation\nIQR (Interquartile Range)\nRange\n\nSure enough, the numpy module contains several functions which help us compute these measures. Let’s examine each separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3\n\n\n\n\nLook up the help file on the function np.ptp(), and describe what it does. Also, answer the question: what does ptp actually stand for?\nNow, apply the np.ptp() function on your x_list and x_array variables from Task 1 above and check that it functions like you expect.\n\n\n\nNext, we tackle a slightly peculiar function: np.std(). We expect this to compute the standard deviation of a list/array, but…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\n\n\nCompute the standard deviation of the x_list variable from Task 1 by hand, and write down the answer using a comment or Markdown cell.\nNow, run np.std(x_list). Does this answer agree with what you found in part (a) above?\nNow, recompute the standard deviation of x_list by hand but this time use \\((1/n)\\) instead of \\((1 / n - 1)\\) in the formula. How does this answer compare with the result of np.std(x_list)?\n\n\n\nThe result of the previous Task is the following: given a list x = [x1, x2, ..., xn], running np.std(x) actually computes \\[ \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2 } \\] as opposed to our usual definition of standard deviation \\[ s_X = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} \\] We can actually fix this issue by passing in an additional argument to the np.std() function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4 (cont’d)\n\n\n\n\nRun np.std(x_list, ddof = 1) and check whether this matches the result of part (a) above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\nTo compute the standard deviation of a list x, we run np.std(x, ddof = 1).\n\n\nFinally, we turn to the IQR: to compute the IQR of a list/array x, we use (after importing numpy as np)\n\nnp.diff(np.percentile(x, [25,75]))[0]"

The module we will use to generate visualizations in this class is the matplotlib module (though there are quite a few other modules that work for visualizations as well). The official website for matplotlib can be found at https://matplotlib.org/.\n\nBefore we generate any plots, we will need to run the following code once:\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')\n\nHere’s what these lines of code are doing:\n\n%matplotlib inline tells Jupyter to actually display our plots in our notebook (if we didn’t include this line, our plots wouldn’t display)\nimport matplotlib imports the matplotlib module\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt imports the pyplot submodule (a submodule is just a module contained within another larger module) with the abbreviation plt.\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid') tells Jupyter to use a specific theme (called seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid) when generating plots.\n\nAgain, notice the beauty of the import <module> as <abbreviation> syntax- after running the third line above, we no longer need to write matplotlib.pyplot, just plt! Also, there are lots of other themes you can use when generating your plots: after completing this lab, I encourage you to consult this reference guide for a list of a few other pyplot themes.\n\nBoxplots and Histograms\nNow, let’s proceed on to make some plots. The first two types of plots we will look at are the two we used to describe numerical data: namely, boxplots and histograms. The functions we will use are the plt.boxplot() and plt.his() functions, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5\n\n\n\n\nMake a list called y that contains the following elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2].\nRun plt.boxplot(y); (be sure to include the semicolon!). With any luck, your plot should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make our boxplot horizontal, as opposed to vertical. Consult the help file on the matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot() function here and figure out how to position your boxplot horizontally. Your new plot should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s add some color to our plot. Within your call to plt.boxplot(), add the following: patch_artist=True, boxprops = dict(facecolor = \"aquamarine\") (don’t worry too much about what exactly this code is doing). Your boxplot should now look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s add a Title! Right below your call to plt.boxplot(), add the following: plt.title(\"My First Python Boxplot\"); (again, note the semicolons). Your final plot should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for a review: based on the boxplot we just generated, what is the IQR of y? Write your answer in a Markdown cell. Then, use the syntax discussed in the previous section of this Lab to use Python to compute the IQR of y, and comment on the result.\n\n\n\nOf course, boxplots are not the only way to summarize numerical variables: we also have histograms!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6\n\n\n\nCall the plt.hist() function on the y list defined in Task 3, and use the help file to add arguments to your call to plt.hist() function to generate the following plot:\n\n\n\n\n\nPay attention to the number of bins!\n\n\n\n\nScatterplots\nWe should also quickly discuss how to generate scatterplots in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7\n\n\n\n\nCopy-paste the following code into a code cell, and then run that cell (don’t worry about what this code is doing- we’ll discuss that in a future lab).\n\n\nnp.random.seed(5)\n\nx1 = np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)\nx2 = x1 + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)\n\nplt.scatter(x1, x2);\n\nYour plot should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an x-axis label that says \"x1\" and a y-axis label that says \"x2\", along with the title “My First Python Scatterplot”. Your final plot should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes there appear to be an association between the variables x1 and x2? If so, is the association positive or negative? Linear or nonlinear?

    "section": "Plotting a Function",
    "text": "Plotting a Function\nFinally, I’d like to take a quick detour from descriptive statistics and talk about how to plot a function using Python. As a concrete example, let’s try and plot a sine curve from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\nIf you recall, on Lab01 we used the sin() function from the math module- it turns out that the numpy module (which, recall, we have imported as np) also has a sin() function, so let’s use that one today:\n\nnp.sin()\n\nNext, we create a set of finely-spaced points between our two desired endpoints (in this case, \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\), respectively). We will do so using the np.linspace() function, which works as follows:\n\nnp.linspace(start, stop, num)\n\ncreates a set of num evenly-spaced values between start and stop, respectively. For instance:\n\nnp.linspace(0, 1, 10)\n\narray([ 0.        ,  0.11111111,  0.22222222,  0.33333333,  0.44444444,\n        0.55555556,  0.66666667,  0.77777778,  0.88888889,  1.        ])\n\n\nIn the context of plotting, the more points we generate the smoother our plot will seem (you will see what this means in a minute). As such, let’s start with 150 points between 0 and 2 * pi:\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 150)\n\nFinally, we call the plt.plot() function on x and np.sin(x) to generate our plot:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(4.5, 2.25))\nplt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see what would have happened if we used fewer values in our np.linspace() call:\n\nxnew = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 10)\nplt.plot(xnew, np.sin(xnew))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the more points we include in our call to np.linspace(), the smoother our final function will look!\n\nSo, to summarize, here is the general “recipe” to plot a function f() between two values a and b in Python:\n\nLet x = np.linspace(a, b, <some large value>)\nCall plt.plot(x, f(x))\nAdd labels/titles as necessary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 8\n\n\n\nGenerate a plot of the function \\(f(x) = x - x^2 \\sin(x)\\) between \\(x = -10\\) and \\(x = 10\\). Experiment around with the number of values generated by np.linspace() to ensure your plot is relatively smooth. Be sure to include axis labels; also, change the color of the graph to red. Your final plot should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE\n\n\n\nYou only need to complete up to here during Lab, but you should complete the following tasks on your own as they are fair game for quizzes and exams (and are also very useful for your own edification!)\n\n\n\nOverlaying Plots\nSometimes it will be useful to overlay two plots on top of each other. Recall that, for a function f() and a variable x that has been assigned a value resulting from a call to numpy.linspace(), we generate a graph of f() using (assuming matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt)\n\nplt.plot(x, f(x));\n\nIt stands to reason, then that given another function g() we should be able to superimpose the graph of g() onto the graph of f() by simply adding another call to plt.plot():\n\nplt.plot(x, f(x));\nplt.plot(x, g(x));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 9\n\n\n\nGenerate a graph of sin(); on top of this graph, superimpose the graph of cos(). Restrict the x values on your graph to be between \\(-4\\pi\\) and \\(4\\pi\\). Your final graph should look like the following (pay attention to the axis labels and title!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as it stands, it’s a bit difficult to determine which curve corresponds to the sine curve and which corresponds to the cosine curve. As such, we should add some labels!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 10\n\n\n\nCopy your code from Task 9 above into a new code cell, and\n\nadd label = \"sine\" to your call to plt.plot() containing the sine curve\nadd label = \"cosine\" to your call to plt.plot() containing the cosine curve.\n\nDoes this new plot look any different than the plot you generated in Task 3?\n\n\nHm, doesn’t look like anything changed… That’s because we didn’t add a legend to our plot! To add a legend, we simply tack on a call to plt.legend() after our code from above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 11\n\n\n\nCopy your code from Task 10 above into a new code cell, and add a line underneath it containing a call to plt.legend(). Look up the help file to figure out what arguments you need to pass in to obtain the following graph (note the position of the legend):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, we’re almost there! The only issue is that now the legend is covered up by the actual graphs. One way we can fix this is by extending the \\(y-\\)axis further, using the function plt.ylim():\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 12\n\n\n\nCopy your code from Task 11 above into a new code cell, and add a line underneath it containing a call to plt.ylim(). Look up the help file to figure out what arguments you need to pass in to obtain a lower \\(y-\\)limit of \\(-1.5\\) and an upper \\(y-\\)limit of \\(2.0\\). Your final graph should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is sometimes considered bad form to rely too heavily on colors in plots. This is because doing so alienates readers who are colorblind. One way around this is to rely on different line types; e.g. used dashed lines for one graph and dotted lines for another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 13\n\n\n\nCopy your code from Task 12 above into a new code cell. Read the following help file and figure out how to pass in a value to the linestyle argument to your two calls to plt.plot() to generate the following plot:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the sine curve is now dotted, and the cosine curve is now dashed."

    "text": "Tables\nAnother very useful data structure in Python is that of a table. Python tables behave pretty much the same as the tables we’ve used in, say, math- they are a grid of values arranged sequentially.\n\nTables can be created using the Table() function in Python, which itself comes from the datascience module. The general syntax of creating a table with the Table() function is:\n\nTable().with_columns(\n  \"<col 1 name>\", [<col 1, val 1>, <col 1, val 2>, ... ],\n  \"<col 2 name>\", [<col 2, val 1>, <col 2, val 2>, ... ],\n  ...\n)\n\nFor example,\n\nTable().with_columns(\n  \"Name\", [\"Ethan\", \"Morgan\", \"Amy\"],\n  \"ID\", [12345, 10394, 20343],\n  \"Office\", [\"South Hall\", \"South Hall\", \"North Hall\"]\n)\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Name ID Office\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Ethan  12345 South Hall\n        \n        \n            Morgan 10394 South Hall\n        \n        \n            Amy    20343 North Hall\n        \n    \n\n\n\nThere is nothing stopping us from assigning a table to a variable! For example, after running\n\ntable1 = Table().with_columns(\n  \"Name\", [\"Ethan\", \"Morgan\", \"Amy\"],\n  \"ID\", [12345, 10394, 20343],\n  \"Fav_Drink\", [\"Iced Tea\", \"Coffee\", \"Sprite\"]\n)\n\nthe variable table1 is equivalent to the table displayed above:\n\ntable1\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Name ID Fav_Drink\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Ethan  12345 Iced Tea \n        \n        \n            Morgan 10394 Coffee   \n        \n        \n            Amy    20343 Sprite   \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\n\nSometimes in Python we will encounter expressions of the form\n\n<object type>.<function name>()\n\nIn this syntax, the function <function name> is said to be a method. For example, the function with_columns() is a method for the Table object.\n\n\nThe datascience module contains a plethora of methods we can use to manage tables. For example, the select() method can be used to select columns by name:\n\ntable1.select(\"ID\")\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            ID\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            12345\n        \n        \n            10394\n        \n        \n            20343\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\nMethods are always appended to either a function that creates a blank object type (like Table()) or a variable of the correct type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\n\nRead the list of methods for Table objects at http://data8.org/datascience/tables.html, and write down (in a code cell, using comments) at least three different methods, including a short description of what each method does.

Hint: think about how you can use our discussion on updating variable values from last lab. Also, the method .with_row() may be useful; see the help file at http://data8.org/datascience/tables.html for more information.\n\n\nSuppose we want to select rows of a table that satisfy a given condition. For example, if we wanted to find the information of only people who like Sprite in the table1 table above, we would call\n\ntable1.where(\"Fav_Drink\", \"Sprite\")\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Name ID Fav_Drink\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Amy  20343 Sprite   \n        \n    \n\n\n\nWhat would happen if we tried to select the rows of table1 with Coke in the Fav_Drink column? Well, since there is nobody in table1 that has coke as their favorite drink, we should hope that Python returns an empty table.\n\ntable1.where(\"Fav_Drink\", \"Coke\")\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Name ID Fav_Drink\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nSure enough, Python has returned an empty table!"

However, there are a few key differences between them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6\n\n\n\nMake a list called my_list containing the elements 1, 2, and 3, and make an array called my_array also containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.

One important limitation about arrays, though, is that the elements in an array must all be of the same data type. If you try to make an array consisting of elements that are different data types Python will still run, however it will not run in the way you expect it to!"

    "section": "Comparisons",
    "text": "Comparisons\nHere’s a question: is 2 less than 3? Well, yes it is! If we wanted to confirm this, we could simply ask Python whether 2 is less than 3 by running\n\n2 < 3\n\nTrue\n\n\nNotice, however, how Python answered this question: it simply returned True. Let’s see what the data type of True is:\n\ntype(True)\n\nbool\n\n\nTrue is of the type bool, which is short for boolean. There are only two boolean quantities in Python: True and False. Let’s see how we can generate a False value:\n\n3 < 2\n\nFalse\n\n\nHere is a list of comparison operators, taken from the Inferential Thinking textbook:\n\n\n\nComparison\nOperator\nTrue Example\nFalse Example\n\n\n\n\nLess than\n<\n2 < 3\n2 < 2\n\n\nGreater than\n>\n3 < 2\n3 > 3\n\n\nLess than or equal\n<=\n2 <= 2\n3 <= 2\n\n\nGreater than or equal\n>=\n3 >= 3\n2 >= 3\n\n\nEqual\n==\n3 == 3\n3 == 2\n\n\nNot equal\n!=\n3 != 2\n2 != 2\n\n\n\nOne nice thing about Python is that it allows for multiple simultaneous comparisons. For example,\n\n2 < 3 < 4\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn a multiple comparison, Python will only return True when all of the included comparisons are true.\n\n\nFor instance, 2 < 3 < 1 would return False, because even though 2 is less than 3 it is not true that 3 is less than 1.\n\nBelieve it or not, you can compare strings as well! Python compares strings alphabetically; that is, letters at the beginning of the alphabet are considered to have smaller ordinal value than letters at the end of the alphabet. For example:\n\n\"apple\" < \"banana\"\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\"zebra\" < \"zanzibar\"\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n\"cat\" <= \"catenary\"\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7\n\n\n\nCheck how \"statistics\" and \"Statistics\" (note the capitalization!) compare. Use this to answer the question: when Python is comparing strings, does it give precedence to capital letters or not? If so, which (lowercase or capital) is given a “higher” value?\n\n\nFinally, we discuss how comparisons work in the context of lists and arrays. The way Python compares lists is by what is known as lexicographical order. From the official Python help documentation, this means\n\nfirst the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted.\n\nFor instance, [1, 2, 3] < [2, 1, 1] would return True since 1 (the first element of the first list) is less than 2 (the first element of the second list).\n\nThe comparison of arrays is a little more straightforward, except\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen comparing two arrays, the arrays must be of the same length.\n\n\nTo see exactly how comparison of arrays works, let’s work through a Task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 8\n\n\n\nMake an array with the elements 1, 2, and 3, and call this x. Make another array with the elements 2, 3, 1, and call this y. Run x < y, and comment on the result.\n\n\nWhat the previous task illustrates is that Python compares arrays element-wise."

    "text": "Conditionals\nNow, we can use comparisons for much more than verifying simple arithmetic relationships. One of the main areas in which comparisons arise is the area of conditional expressions.\n\nSimply put, conditional expressions are how we can convey a set of choices to Python. As an example, let’s consider finding someone’s city based on their zip code. To simplify, let’s assume the only zip codes we consider are 9311, 93120, and 93150. From postal data, we know that:\n\na zip code of 93117 corresponds to Goleta\na zip code of 93120 corresponds to Santa Barbara\na zip code of 93150 corresponds to Montecito\n\nWe can rephrase this information in terms of “if” statements:\n\nIf a person has a zip code of 93117, then they are in Goleta\nOtherwise, if they have a zip code of 93120, then they are in Santa Barbara\nOtherwise, if they have a zip code of 93150, then they are in Montecito\n\nThis is precisely the syntax we would use when translating this experiment into Python syntax:\n\nif zip_code == 93117:\n  location = \"Goleta\"\nelif zip_code == 93120:\n  location = \"Santa Barbara\"\nelif zip_code == 93150:\n  location = \"Montecito\"\n\nBy the way: elif is an abbreviation for else if, which itself can be thought of as equivalent to otherwise, if.\n\nHere’s the general syntax of a conditional expression in Python:\n\nif <condition 1>:\n  <task 1>\nelif <condition 2>:\n  <task 2>\n...\nelse:\n  <final task>\n\nWhen executing the above conditional statement, Python first checks whether <condition 1> returns a value of True or False. If it returns a value of True, then <task 1> is executed and the statement ends. Otherwise, Python checks whether <task 2> is True or False; if it is True then <condition 2> is executed, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn the example code above: if <condition 1> is True, then no tasks beyond <task 1> are evaluated. If <condition 2> is True, then no tasks beyond <task 2> are evaluated. And so on and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 9\n\n\n\nConsider the code:\n\nx = 2\n\nif x < 2:\n    x = \"hello\"\nelif x < 3:\n    x = \"goodbye\"\nelse:\n    x = \"take care\"\n\nBefore running any code, write down what you think the result of executing x would be. Then, run the loop, execute x, and check whether your answer was correct or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIndentation is very important in Python.\n\n\nFor example, if instead of the conditional expression in Task 2 we had instead put\n\nx = 2\n\nif x < 2:\nx = \"hello\"\nelif x < 3:\nx = \"goodbye\"\nelse:\nx = \"take care\"\n\nthen we would have received an error!"

We’ve already been using quite a few functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 10\n\n\n\nIn a Markdown cell, write down three functions we’ve used in Lab thus far.\n\n\nIf you recall, the general syntax for calling a function is:\n\n<function name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ... )\n\nwhere <function name> denotes the function name and <arg1>, <arg2>, etc. denote the arguments of the function.\n\nCreating your own function in Python is actually fairly simple! Here is the syntax we use:\n\ndef <function name>(<list out the argument names>):\n  \"\"\"include a 'docstring' here\"\"\"\n  <body of the function>\n  return <what you want the function to output>\n\nFor example,\n\ndef f(x, y):\n  \"\"\"returns x^2 + y^2\"\"\"\n  return x**2 + y**2\n\ncreates a function f that can be called on two arguments, x and y, and returns the sum of squares of the arguments; e.g.\n\nf(3, 4)  # should return 3^2 + 4^2 = 25\n\n25\n\n\nBy the way, the docstring referenced above is a verbal description of what the function does. (Recall from Lab01 that it is just a multi-line comment, since it is enclosed in triple quotation marks!). All functions should include a docstring to convey to the user what the function does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you don’t include a return statement in the definition of a function, then your function will never return anything.\n\n\nFor instance,\n\ndef g(x, y):\n  \"\"\"should return x^2 + y^2\"\"\"\n  x**2 + y**2\n\ng(3, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 11\n\n\n\nWrite a function called cent_to_far() which takes in a single temperature c as measured in degrees Centigrade and returns the corresponding temperature in degrees Farenheit. Check that cent_to_far(0) correctly returns 0 and cent_to_far(68) correctly returns 69.7777. As a reminder: \\[ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F} = \\frac{5}{9} ({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) + 32 \\]\n\n\nFinally, let’s combine some things by way of a concluding Task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 12\n\n\n\nWrite a function called parity() that returns the parity (i.e. whether a number is even or odd) of an input x. Call your parity() function on 2 and then 3 to make sure your function behaves as expected. Some hints:\n\nRecall that % is the modulus operator in Python. Specifically, x % y returns the remainder of performing y divided by x.\nRecall that even numbers are divisible by 2 (so what does this mean about the remainder of dividing x by 2 if x is even?)"

    "text": "Comments\nWhen writing large pieces of code, programmers will often utilize comments to annotate their work and help readers understand what their code is doing. In Python there are two types of comments: inline comments and multiline comments. Inline comments are created using the hashtag (#) and multiline comments must be enclosed in three quotation marks (\"\"\"). As an example of both, consider the following snippet of code:\n\nx = 1             # define x\ny = 2             # define y\nz = (x + y) ** 2  # define z\ny = z / 3         # redefine y\n\n\"\"\"This code is defines 3 variables,\ncalled 'x', 'y', and 'z'.\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7\n\n\n\nGo back and add some descriptive comments to some of your previous code cells. (You don’t need a separate markdown cell indicating you have done so.)"

Update the variable num_sections to be one more than when you initially defined it above. (Don’t just use num_sections = 5- think about our discussion on updating variables above!)\n(b) Using comments, write down what you think the output of each of the following expressions will be:\n\ntype(course)\ntype(num_sections)\nnum_sections * section_capacity\n\nThen, run each expression in a separate code chunk and comment on the results.\n(c) Create a new variable called course_capacity and assign it the value of the maximum capacity of the course. (Hint: there are only 5 sections, and each section has a maximum capacity of 25. Try to use your already-defined variables as much as possible!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe type() function can be used to identify the data type of a particular quantity."

Your TA will explain more about the structure of lab during your first Section meeting of the quarter.\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes will be administered asynchronously on Fridays, through Gradescope. Specifically, the quiz will remain open from 10am until 11:59pm, and you must find 40 consecutive minutes to take the quiz. (Consecutive means you cannot start the quiz, and then come back to it later- once you start, you will have 40 minutes to both complete the quiz as well as upload your work). I encourage you to spend 25 minutes working on the quiz, and 15 minutes uploading. No quiz scores will be dropped. There are no quizzes in Exam Weeks.\n\n\nExams\nThere are two midterms and a final exam for this class. You are required to take all three exams; failure to do so will result in an automatic grade of “F”, so please ensure you are able to take the exams on the dates listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Dates:\n\n\n\n\nMidterm 1 is scheduled to take place Thursday July 6 from 11:00am - 12:20pm (lecture time)\nMidterm 2 is scheduled to take place Thursday July 20 from 11:00am - 12:20pm (lecture time)\nThe final is scheduled to take place FRIDAY, AUGUST 4 from 4 - 7pm\n\n\n\nAll exams are scheduled to take place in our lecture classroom, ILP 1101. Unless stated otherwise, all exams will be cumulative.\n\n\nHomework:\nHomework for this class will be neither collected nor graded. However, the weekly quizzes will be based heavily (though potentially not entirely) off the homework assignments. Homework assignments will be released on Mondays, along with their final answers. Solutions will be posted biweekly, on the Tuesdays before exams. As such, you should not rely on the solutions to help you study; instead, please come to office hours to check your work regularly!\n\n\nSchedule of Due Dates\nA tentative schedule of release and due dates can be found here"

In other words, there are an infinite number of possible heights between, say, 5 feet and 6 feet.\nOn the other hand, it doesn’t make sense to talk about “1.5 accidents” occurring on a stretch of highway; the number of accidents needs to be an integer."

    "text": "Small Caveat\n\nI should quickly mention one small caveat- computing softwares often use a different procedure for computing quartiles.\nThis procedure is quite long and complicated, and is based off an entire paper written back in the 90’s.\nFor example, if we consider the set \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), we would (based on the definition from the previous slide) call the first quartile \\(2\\), whereas most softwares would return a value of \\(2.25\\).\nDon’t worry about why this is- whenever we talk about quartiles in this class, you can just think of the definition I posed on the previous slide."

    "text": "Whiskers\n\nFinally, we discuss the role of the whiskers on the boxplot.\nThere are several different conventions for how far the whiskers extend. In some conventions, the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values of the data.\nThe convention we will use is the following: the whiskers will never reach farther than \\(\\boldsymbol{1.5 \\times (Q_3 - Q_1)}\\).\n\nWhat this means is that there may be points in our dataset that lie beyond the reach of the whiskers. These points are what we call outliers."

    "text": "Whiskers\n\n\nThe rationale for constructing the whiskers in this way is to try and highlight any points that are unusually distant from the rest of the data.\n\n\n\nFor example, returning to our dataset of scores, we can see that though the median score was around 80.3% there was one person who scored a 97.9%. Because this score is unusually large, we would label it an outlier."
