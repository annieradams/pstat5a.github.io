There are a number of programming languages currently in use, with names such as R, Julia, MatLab, and - the language we will use for this course - Python.\n\nPython programs can be written in a number of different environments, such as a text editor (e.g. Notepad, VS Code, etc.) or a Terminal window. For this class, we will use Jupyter Notebook (where Jupyter is pronounced like the planet), an interactive environment that has the added benefit of being hosted online, meaning you do not have to download anything onto your personal machines in order to run Python code!"

Now, it’s time for our first task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\n\n\n\nChange the name of your notebook to “Lab01” using the following steps:\n\nIn the lefthand menu bar, find the notebook you just created (by default this will be something like “Untitled” or “Untitled1”), and right-click and click “Rename” (see picture below)\n\n\n\nRename your file to “Lab01”, and then hit the return (enter) key on your keyboard. You should see the filename in the menubar update:\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyterHub Environment\nLet’s take a minute to familiarize ourselves with the JupyterHub environment. Every Jupyter notebook is comprised of what are known as cells; these are the shaded grey rectangles that appear in a Jupyter notebook.\n\nIf your cell has a grey background (like in the image above), it is inactive. To activate a cell, place your cursor inside it, and click:\n\nmeans it is selected and active, and ready to be populated with text and/or code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you run code using the “Run” button at the top of your environment, only the active cell will be executed.\n\n\n\n\nCells\nThere are two main types of cells we will be using in this class: Markdown cells (which include text/descriptions, but no code) and code cells (which contain code that needs to be run). We’ll be talking a bit more about Markdown cells in a few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, click into the code cell that was automatically created when you created your document to activate it.\nClick on the dropdown menu that currently says “code” (near the center of the top of your interface), and select “Markdown”\n\n\n\nClick back into the cell, copy-paste the text [including the hashtag!] # Task 2, and then run the cell by clicking on the button that looks like a “play” symbol at the top of your window:\n\n\n\nNote that after running your cell from step 3 above, Jupyter automatically created a new code cell. Click into this code cell and run the code 2 + 2.\n\nWhen you are done, your notebook should look something like this:\n\n\n\nNotice that after running a cell, Jupyter automatically adds a new cell right after it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo run a cell and automatically create a new cell underneath it, use the keyboard shortcut SHIFT + ENTER.\n\n\nBy the way, do you notice the little In [1]: at the left of our first cell? This is Jupyter’s way of letting us know the order in which the code cells have been executed. The 1 in our cell from Task 2 above corresponds to the fact that this was the 1st code cell we executed in our document."

This means that they each have their own syntax (i.e. set of grammar rules). It is precisely the Syntax of the Python language that we will be learning over the course of these Computing Labs!\n\nPrograms are made up of expressions, like 2 + 2. We evaluate expressions by running (or executing) them in a programming language. Expressions are like the sentences of programming- they contain complex pieces of information that are conveyed between the user and the computer.\n\nMuch like sentences in other languages, expressions must obey a rigid syntax. For example, when we want to perform addition in Python we must use the + symbol; we can’t, for example, say 2 plus 2.\n\nWhat happens when we violate a syntax rule? Well…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mardown cell and write # Task 3\nCreate a code cell, and run 2 plus 2. (You should get an error!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor this class, we expect you to precede each code cell from a particular task with a markdown cell that says # Task X (where X is the number of the task).\n\nWe will stop explicitly writing this step in the tasks below, but you are still expected to include a labeling cell!\n\n\nWell, what is this error saying? Let’s examine it more closely.\n\n  File \"<ipython-input-2-5196071441ec>\", line 1\n    2 plus 2\n      ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nIndeed, Python is telling us exactly what went wrong- the SyntaxError part of the error message tells us that we violated one of the syntax rules of Python, and the ^ pointing to the p in plus is telling us that the exact syntax error occurred when we tried to use the word plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways read error messages!\n\n\nThe messages that Python displays when we get an error are Python’s way of trying to communicate with us what is going wrong!"

Indeed, even the most experience coder will often run up against errors like this, and need to subsequently enter the stage of debugging their code.\n\nWe’re now getting a new error: this time, it’s a NameError. As the name suggests, this is Python’s way of telling us that it doesn’t recognize the name of something we’ve written. In fact, it’s explicitly saying:\n\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined,\n\nThis is Python’s way of telling us that it (somehow) doesn’t know what sin means.\n\nTo answer the question of why this is, we need to take a bit of a detour into the world of modules."

    "text": "Python Modules\nIt is important to note that all Python objects take up space in the form of memory (i.e. storage space on your computer). Nowadays, with the recent innovations in computers, this is not so much of an issue but historically, when many of these programming languages were first being created, optimizing space was of the utmost concern. (Even today, efficiency is a guiding tenet of most programmers!)\n\nThink of it this way- if you are doing work on code that doesn’t involve much trigonometry, there isn’t a whole lot of need to have the sin function readily available. The idea programmers had was to compartmentalize, and store certain functions in what are known as modules.\n\nModules are Python files containing definitions for functions and classes (we’ll talk about classes a little later). While data types and built-in functions in the Python standard library are available for immediate use, modules need to be imported first.\n\nThe syntax for importing all functions from a module is:\n\nfrom <module name> import *\n\nSometimes, we may not want to import the entirety of a module and instead import only a couple of functions from that module. In that case, we would use the syntax:\n\nfrom <module name> import <function name>\n\nWe’ll talk a bit more about modules in a future lab. For now, let’s return to our task of computing \\(\\sin(1)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5 (cont’d)\n\n\n\nIt turns out that the sin() function is located in the math module Load all functions from the math module, and then try re-running sin(1)."

For now, suffice it to say that Python functions work just like mathematical functions: for example, note how we used the sin() function in the previous task. One piece of terminology that is somewhat specific to programming is the notion of calling- when we say to call a function on an argument, we mean to pass that argument through the function. So, for example, in Task 5 we called the sin() function on the argument 1."

Just like in math, variables in a programming language refer to a placeholder name for a particular piece of information (be it a function, value, etc.) The act of storing information in a variable is called assignment, and in Python variable assignment is performed using the = symbol.\n\n<variable name> = <what you want to associate with the variable>\n\nFor example, after running\n\nx = 2\n\nthe quantity x will always be synonymous with the quantity 2, and running x + 2 will return a value of 4 (as 2 + 2 = 4).\n\nPython affords a lot of flexibility when it comes to variable names- that is, we can pick almost anything we want to be a variable name! There are, however, some exceptions:\n\nVariable names cannot start with a number\nVariable names cannot include a space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is a good programming practice to give your variables names that are descriptive, but not overly long.\n\n\nIf we want to view the value stored in a variable, we have two options: we could simply type the name of the variable, and run the cell:\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\nor we could pass the variable name into a call to the print() function:\n\nprint(x)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6\n\n\n\n(a) Define a variable called my_variable, and assign it the value 5.\n(b) Now, run the command print(My_variable) (note the capitalization!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPython is case-sensitive.\n\n\nSometimes it will be necessary to update or re-assign a new value to an existing variable. For example, let’s examine the structure of the following code:\n\nx = 2\nx = x + 3\n\nWhat do you think running x will return? If you said 5, you’d be correct! The key point of this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn variable assignment, Python starts by executing the righthand side of the equality before executing the lefthand side.\n\n\nSo, in code example above, Python first executed x + 3 (which is equivalent to 2 + 3; i.e. 5), and then re-assigned x the value 5."

Your lowest homework score will be dropped.\n\nHomework assignments will typically be released on Wednesdays and be due on Tuesdays, with the exception of Exam Weeks when the homework will be due on Monday.\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes will be administered on Wednesdays, During your Lab Section. Make-up quizzes will not be offered; instead, your lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the quarter. There are no quizzes in Exam Weeks.\n\n\nExams\nThere are two midterms and a final exam for this class. You are required to take all three exams; failure to do so will result in an automatic grade of “F”, so please ensure you are able to take the exams on the dates listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Dates:\n\n\n\n\nMidterm 1 is scheduled to take place Tuesday, April 25 from 2 - 3:15pm (lecture time)\nMidterm 2 is scheduled to take place Tuesday, May 23 from 2 - 3:15pm (lecture time)\nThe final is scheduled to take place Tuesday, June 13 from 4 - 7pm (as determined by the University)\n\n\n\nThe midterms are scheduled to take place in Embarcadero Hall, and will have assigned seating. The Final Exam is currently scheduled to take place in our regular classroom, though there is a possibility of moving the exam to a larger classroom- such a change will be announced well in advance of the date of the Final.

Collaboration on homework assignments is perfectly acceptable (even encouraged) but the work you submit should still be your own; you can’t have someone else write up solutions for you, nor can you consult cites like Chegg, CourseHero, etc. Anyone found guilty of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Senate, and will receive at minimum a failing grade on the assignment in question; further actions may also include failing the course, and marks being made on permanent records. Depending on the severity of the infraction, expulsion is also a possibility.\nBasically, don’t cheat- please! If you’re ever struggling with course material, please come talk to me or the TA’s.

These points are what we call outliers."

Because this score is unusually large, we would label it an outlier."
