There are a number of programming languages currently in use, with names such as R, Julia, MatLab, and - the language we will use for this course - Python.\n\nPython programs can be written in a number of different environments, such as a text editor (e.g. Notepad, VS Code, etc.) or a Terminal window. For this class, we will use Jupyter Notebook (where Jupyter is pronounced like the planet), an interactive environment that has the added benefit of being hosted online meaning you do not have to download anything onto your personal machines in order to run Python code!"

Now, it’s time for our first task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\n\n\n\nChange the name of your notebook to “Lab01” using the following steps:\n\nIn the lefthand menu bar, find the notebook you just created (by default this will be something like “Untitled” or “Untitled1”), and right-click and click “Rename” (see picture below)\n\n\n\nRename your file to “Lab01”, and then hit the return (enter) key on your keyboard. You should see the filename in the menubar update:\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyterHub Environment\nLet’s take a minute to familiarize ourselves with the JupyterHub environment. Every Jupyter notebook is comprised of what are known as cells; these are the shaded grey rectangles that appear in a Jupyter notebook.\n\nIf your cell has a grey background (like in the image above), it is inactive. To activate a cell, place your cursor inside it, and click:\n\nmeans it is selected and active, and ready to be populated with text and/or code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you run code using the “Run” button at the top of your environment, only the active cell will be executed.\n\n\n\n\nCells\nThere are two main types of cells we will be using in this class: Markdown cells (which include text/descriptions, but no code) and code cells (which contain code that needs to be run). We’ll be talking a bit more about Markdown cells in a few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, click into the code cell that was automatically created when you created your document to activate it.\nClick on the dropdown menu that currently says “code” (near the center of the top of your interface), and select “Markdown”\n\n\n\nClick back into the cell, copy-paste the text [including the hashtag!] # Task 2, and then run the cell by clicking on the button that looks like a “play” symbol at the top of your window:\n\n\n\nNote that after running your cell from step 3 above, Jupyter automatically created a new code cell. Click into this code cell and run the code 2 + 2.\n\nWhen you are done, your notebook should look something like this:\n\n\n\nNotice that after running a cell, Jupyter automatically adds a new cell right after it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo run a cell and automatically create a new cell underneath it, use the keyboard shortcut SHIFT + ENTER.\n\n\nBy the way, do you notice the little In [1]: at the left of our first cell? This is Jupyter’s way of letting us know the order in which the code cells have been executed. The 1 in our cell from Task 2 above corresponds to the fact that this was the 1st code cell we executed in our document."

    "text": "Coding with Python\nThere is a reason we use the word “language” to describe programming languages- that is because they function quite like a human language. This means that they each have their own syntax (i.e. set of grammar rules). It is precisely the syntax of the Python language that we will be learning over the course of these Computing Labs!\n\nPrograms are made up of expressions, like 2 + 2. We evaluate expressions by running (or executing) them in a programming language. Expressions are like the sentences of programming- they contain complex pieces of information that are conveyed between the user and the computer.\n\nMuch like sentences in other languages, expressions must obey a rigid syntax. For example, when we want to perform addition in Python we must use the + symbol; we can’t, for example, say 2 plus 2.\n\nWhat happens when we violate a syntax rule? Well…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mardown cell and write # Task 3\nCreate a code cell, and run 2 plus 2. (You should get an error!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor this class, we expect you to precede each code cell from a particular task with a markdown cell that says # Task X (where X is the number of the task).\n\nWe will stop explicitly writing this step in the tasks below, but you are still expected to include a labeling cell!\n\n\nWell, what is this error saying? Let’s examine it more closely.\n\n  File \"<ipython-input-2-5196071441ec>\", line 1\n    2 plus 2\n      ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nIndeed, Python is telling us exactly what went wrong- the SyntaxError part of the error message tells us that we violated one of the syntax rules of Python, and the ^ pointing to the p in plus is telling us that the exact syntax error occurred when we tried to use the word plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways read error messages!\n\n\nThe messages that Python displays when we get an error are Python’s way of trying to communicate with us what is going wrong!"

Indeed, even the most experience coder will often run up against errors like this, and need to subsequently enter the stage of debugging their code.\n\nWe’re now getting a new error: this time, it’s a NameError. As the name suggests, this is Python’s way of telling us that it doesn’t recognize the name of something we’ve written. In fact, it’s explicitly saying:\n\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined,\n\nSpecifically, Python is telling us that it (somehow) doesn’t know what sin means. Why? Well, to answer that, we need to take a bit of a detour into the world of modules."

    "text": "Python Modules\nIt is important to note that all Python objects take up space in the form of memory (i.e. storage space on your computer). Nowadays, with recent innovations in computers and computer memory, this is not so much of an issue but historically, when many of these programming languages were first being created, optimizing space was of the utmost concern. (Even today, efficiency is a guiding tenet of most programmers!)\n\nThink of it this way- if you are doing work on code that doesn’t involve much trigonometry, there isn’t a whole lot of need to have the sin function readily available. The idea programmers had was to compartmentalize, and store certain functions in what are known as modules.\n\nModules are Python files containing definitions for functions and classes (we’ll talk about data classes a little later). While data types and built-in functions in the Python standard library are available for immediate use, modules need to be imported first.\n\nThe syntax for importing all functions from a module is:\n\nfrom <module name> import *\n\nSometimes, we may not want to import the entirety of a module and instead import only a couple of functions from that module. In that case, we would use the syntax:\n\nfrom <module name> import <function name>\n\nWe’ll talk a bit more about modules in a future lab. For now, let’s return to our task of computing \\(\\sin(1)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5 (cont’d)\n\n\n\nIt turns out that the sin() function is located in the math module Load all functions from the math module, and then try re-running sin(1)."

For now, suffice it to say that Python functions work just like mathematical functions: for example, note how we used the sin() function in the previous task. One piece of terminology that is somewhat specific to programming is the notion of calling- when we say we call a function on an argument, we mean that we’re passing that argument through the function. So, for example, in Task 5 we called the sin() function on the argument 1."

    "text": "Variable Assignment\nLet’s talk a bit about variables. Just like in math, variables in a programming language refer to a placeholder name for a particular piece of information (be it a function, value, etc.) The act of storing information in a variable is called assignment, and in Python variable assignment is performed using the = symbol.\n\n<variable name> = <what you want to associate with the variable>\n\nFor example, after running\n\nx = 2\n\nthe quantity x will always be synonymous with the quantity 2, and running x + 2 will return a value of 4 (as 2 + 2 = 4).\n\nPython affords a lot of flexibility when it comes to variable names- that is, we can pick almost anything we want to be a variable name! There are, however, some exceptions:\n\nVariable names cannot start with a number\nVariable names cannot include a space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is a good programming practice to give your variables names that are descriptive, but not overly long.\n\n\nIf we want to view the value stored in a variable, we have two options: we could simply type the name of the variable, and run the cell:\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\nor we could pass the variable name into a call to the print() function:\n\nprint(x)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6\n\n\n\n(a) Define a variable called my_variable, and assign it the value 5.\n(b) Now, run the command print(My_variable) (note the capitalization!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPython is case-sensitive.\n\n\nSometimes it will be necessary to update or re-assign a new value to an existing variable. For example, let’s examine the structure of the following code:\n\nx = 2\nx = x + 3\n\nWhat do you think running x will return? If you said 5, you’d be correct! The key point of this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn variable assignment, Python starts by executing the righthand side of the equality before executing the lefthand side.\n\n\nSo, in code example above, Python first executed x + 3 (which is equivalent to 2 + 3; i.e. 5), and then re-assigned x the value 5."

Inline comments are created using the hashtag (#) and multiline comments must be enclosed in three quotation marks (\"\"\"). As an example of both, consider the following snippet of code:\n\nx = 1             # define x\ny = 2             # define y\nz = (x + y) ** 2  # define z\ny = z / 3         # redefine y\n\n\"\"\"This code is defines 3 variables,\ncalled 'x', 'y', and 'z'.\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7\n\n\n\nGo back and add some descriptive comments to some of your previous code cells.

    "text": "Course Components\nThe following are the assignments and metrics that will be used to compute your final grade in this course:\n\nLabs\nEvery Monday you will work through a Lab worksheet that will be posted to the website by the previous day. You will then have until 40 minutes after the end of your scheduled section to submit your work through Gradescope. Your TA will explain more about the structure of lab during your first Section meeting of the quarter.\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes will be administered asynchronously on Fridays, through Gradescope. Specifically, the quiz will remain open from 10am until 11:59pm, and you must find 40 consecutive minutes to take the quiz. (Consecutive means you cannot start the quiz, and then come back to it later- once you start, you will have 40 minutes to both complete the quiz as well as upload your work). I encourage you to spend 25 minutes working on the quiz, and 15 minutes uploading. No quiz scores will be dropped. There are no quizzes in Exam Weeks.\n\n\nExams\nThere are two midterms and a final exam for this class. You are required to take all three exams; failure to do so will result in an automatic grade of “F”, so please ensure you are able to take the exams on the dates listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Dates:\n\n\n\n\nMidterm 1 is scheduled to take place Thursday July 6 from 11:00am - 12:20pm (lecture time)\nMidterm 2 is scheduled to take place Thursday July 20 from 11:00am - 12:20pm (lecture time)\nThe final is scheduled to take place FRIDAY, AUGUST 4 from 4 - 7pm\n\n\n\nAll exams are scheduled to take place in our lecture classroom, ILP 1101. Unless stated otherwise, all exams will be cumulative.\n\n\nHomework:\nHomework for this class will be neither collected nor graded. However, the weekly quizzes will be based heavily (though potentially not entirely) off the homework assignments. Homework assignments will be released on Mondays, along with their final answers. Solutions will be posted biweekly, on the Tuesdays before exams. As such, you should not rely on the solutions to help you study; instead, please come to office hours to check your work regularly!\n\n\nSchedule of Due Dates\nA tentative schedule of release and due dates can be found here"

    "text": "Ordinal vs. Nominal Variables\n\nJust as there was a way to subdivide numerical variables, there is a way to further subdivide categorical variables as well.\nAs an example, consider the following two categorical variables: color, and letter grades (i.e. A, B+, etc.)\n\nFirstly, I hope you can see that both of these variables are indeed categorical: there are only a fixed set of values that “color” and “letter grade” can take, with nothing in between.\nNow, clearly letter grades can be ordered: that is, an A is better than a B, which is better than a C, and so on and so forth.\nIn contrast, “green” isnt inherently better than “red”, which isn’t inherently better than “grey”, and so on and so forth."

    "section": "Small Caveat",
    "text": "Small Caveat\n\nI should quickly mention one small caveat- computing softwares often use a different procedure for computing quartiles.\nThis procedure is quite long and complicated, and is based off an entire paper written back in the 90’s.\nFor example, if we consider the set \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), we would (based on the definition from the previous slide) call the first quartile \\(2\\), whereas most softwares would return a value of \\(2.25\\).\nDon’t worry about why this is- whenever we talk about quartiles in this class, you can just think of the definition I posed on the previous slide."

    "text": "Whiskers\n\nFinally, we discuss the role of the whiskers on the boxplot.\nThere are several different conventions for how far the whiskers extend. In some conventions, the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values of the data.\nThe convention we will use is the following: the whiskers will never reach farther than \\(\\boldsymbol{1.5 \\times (Q_3 - Q_1)}\\).\n\nWhat this means is that there may be points in our dataset that lie beyond the reach of the whiskers. These points are what we call outliers."

    "text": "Whiskers\n\n\nThe rationale for constructing the whiskers in this way is to try and highlight any points that are unusually distant from the rest of the data.\n\n\n\nFor example, returning to our dataset of scores, we can see that though the median score was around 80.3% there was one person who scored a 97.9%. Because this score is unusually large, we would label it an outlier."
